#' GSS 1976-1977 Data on Social Status and Tolerance towards Minorities
#'
#' This dataset contains responses from the General Social Survey (GSS) for the years 1976 and 1977, focusing on social status and tolerance towards minorities
#' The latent class models can be fitted using this dataset replicate the analysis carried on McCutcheon (1985) and Bakk et al. (2014). \cr
#' The data contains some covariates including year of the interview, age, sex, race, degree, and income of respondents.
#' The variables associating social status include father's occupation and education level, and mother's education level, while the variables associating tolerance towards minorities are created by agreeing three related questions: (1) allowing public speaking, (2) allowing teaching, and (3) allowing literatures.

#' Adolescent Depression Data from the Add Health Study
#'
#' This dataset includes responses from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health),
#' focusing on adolescents' experiences with depression. The subjects, who were in Grades 10 and 11 during
#' the 1994-1995 academic year, provided data on at least one measure of adolescent delinquency in Wave 1.
#' These data can be used to replicate the latent class analysis conducted by Collins and Lanza (2008).\cr
#' The dataset includes five covariates, notably grade level and sex of respondents, along with variables
#' capturing depressive emotions: sadness (\code{S1-S4}), feeling disliked (\code{D1-D2}), and feelings of failure (\code{F1-F2}).
#'
#' Responses for these variables were initially categorized as "Never," "Sometimes," "Often," or "Most or All of the Time."
#' In this dataset, responses are recoded as "No" for "Never" and "Yes" for all other responses, providing
#' a longitudinal perspective on adolescent depression from Waves I and II. Variables with suffix \code{"w1"} are from Wave I,
#' and those with suffix \code{"w2"} are from Wave II.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 2061 rows and 18 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{GRADE}}{Respondent's grade level at Wave I}
#'   \item{\code{SEX}}{Respondent's sex \cr levels: (1)\code{Male}, (2)\code{Female}}
