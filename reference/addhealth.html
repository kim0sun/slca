    <p>Responses for these variables were initially categorized as "Never," "Sometimes," "Often," or "Most or All of the Time."
In this dataset, responses are recoded as "No" for "Never" and "Yes" for all other responses, providing
a longitudinal perspective on adolescent depression from Waves I and II. Variables with suffix <code>"w1"</code> are from Wave I,
and those with suffix <code>"w2"</code> are from Wave II.</p>
