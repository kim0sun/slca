`slca` provides comprehensive tools for the implementation of Structural Latent Class Models (SLCM), including Latent Transition Analysis (LTA; Linda M. Collins and Stephanie T. Lanza, 2009) <doi:10.1002/9780470567333>, Latent Class Profile Analysis (LCPA; Hwan Chung et al., 2010) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-985x.2010.00674.x>, and Joint Latent Class Analysis (JLCA; Saebom Jeon et al., 2017) <doi:10.1080/10705511.2017.1340844>, and any other extended models involving multiple latent class variables.

## Installation

You can install the released version of slca from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("slca")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kim0sun/slca")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(slca)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
