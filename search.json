Relating Latent Class Variables : Define relationships one latent class variable influences another. example: formula implies LC2 conditionally dependent LC1. Defining Higher-Level Latent Class Variables: Specify relationships latent class variable measured latent class variables instead manifest indicators. example: indicates latent variable P measured latent class variables LC1, LC2, LC3. formulas, variables lhs influence rhs. constraints argument enforces specific conditions ensure precise inference, measurement invariance. particularly useful longitudinal analysis (eg. LTA LCPA), consistent meanings latent classes across time essential. Measurement Invariance Measurement Model: Ensures probabilities associated latent class variables remain consistent. example: ensures LC1, LC2, LC3 semantically consistent measurement probabilities.
